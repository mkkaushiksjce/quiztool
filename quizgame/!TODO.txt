-MyGames: a master page option, that goes back to user's created game where it can be started or deleted

-Join button: redirects users to a gamelobby and adds them to the game.

-Join by token: games now have a hash of their names. Gamecreator can see it on the masterpage.
Users can join game by given gametoken
If you click on another game, you'll be droped out of the last one

-Delete game: needs to clear the game from all joined users data

-Back to game: redirects to the last joined game if you have an active game

TO DO:

SELECT groups.id, groups.name FROM `groups` INNER JOIN `belong_to_group` ON groups.id = belong_to_group.g_or_u_id WHERE belong_to_group.belong_to_g_id = 1

WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED

Authorization in ModelPolicy is not working properly

-filtering:
sends an AJAX request to the server to only give back results that are fit for the search criteria
(currenty question id and question text works, other options will work after proper implementation of groups)

add custom questions:(only visible for admins)
(form is planned to add custom question to the quiz and option to upload it to database at will)

Name is required in order for the quiz otherwise error message is shown (questions lost in this case)

Database implementation
